## Contributions
- **Pamidi Mohammad Ashraf**:
  - Designed schematic in Eagle
  - Designed PCB in EasyEDA
- **Gowtham N**:
  - Designed schematic in EasyEDA
  - Designed PCB in Eagle

## Concepts & Improvisations
- **Multilayer PCB**: Two copper layers (top and bottom) with Vias for interconnections.
- **Double-sided PCB**: Components placed on both sides to minimize the circuit area.
- **Level 2 Packaging**: Single PCB board with Level 2 interconnections between components and ICs.

## Achievements
- Designed a multilayer (two-layer copper) PCB with zero **ERC** and **DRC** errors.
- Gained experience in both **Eagle Autodesk** and **EasyEDA** software.
